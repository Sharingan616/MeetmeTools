This is a script that allows you to login to meetme and enter a livestream. Your favorites list will be pulled, but otherwise you need to enter the broadcastID of the stream you want to access. To grab a broadcastID, enter the stream on a website browser and then pull the ID from the website URL.

 Main advantage of this tool is for viewing the active viewer count of a Meetme livestream, which is otherwise not visible via the native Meetme app or website.
